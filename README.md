# CryptoBook

Under development. Version 1

Version 1 of this application has been up and running for several months. However, there is still room for improvement (multi-wallet management, position improvement/automation, etc.).

Eventually, this tool will give you a visual overview of all your cryptocurrency positions, a recap of the money you've invested, the money you've earned, a calculation of where to farm, a recap of your NFT earnings, and lots of other cool stuff...
